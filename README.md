# Weather-Application || Challenge-05

## Description

This is the 5th project we've had to do for the coding bootcamp. It proved to be a challenge indeed. The expectation was to be able to use a weather API, get the information of cities and produce their weather in the current day and then 5 days ahead. It was also expected to be able to have the history on the side for a easy click back and see a previous city. 

## Installation

Started with no code and made from scratch. The way to use it, is by using the URL and then searching up cities that you would like to know the weather about!

## Usage

The page is fairly simple to use. Just search a city on the search bar and get results in seconds!

I also used some older code to figure out the Objects and getting them from a fetch statement.
